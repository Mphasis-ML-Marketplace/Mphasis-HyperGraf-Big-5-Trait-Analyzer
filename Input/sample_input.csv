"I thinks that no one should be afraid to go to the doctor because they can't afford it, no one should go broke because they get sick, and no one should die because they could not afford care. If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day., as we all know thoughts are the shadows of our feelings - always darker, emptier and simpler, as said by -Nietzsche,""It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society."" , one more thing I likes the sound of thunder, and the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart.// This isn't brave. It's murder.// What did I ever do to you?// You don't care, do you.// Please proceed to Andorid Hell., needs a stupid, fluffy book to read in between experiences of normalcy., what i had learned that is nothing from 20 years of school.,I fell very low because of this society and this study culture , I really hate all of these I pray to god that every body should hate the study culture we have really hate it."
